## Introduction

The primary goal of this repository is to offer diverse solutions to LeetCode problems, showcasing different algorithmic approaches and their respective trade-offs. Each problem is tackled with a solution that is analyzed in terms of:
- **Runtime**: The time complexity of the solution.
- **Memory Consumption**: The space complexity of the solution.
- **Explanation**: A detailed explanation of the approach, why it was chosen, and any relevant considerations.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized in a straightforward manner to facilitate easy navigation and access:

Leetcode-Problems/\
│\
├── Problem-001/\
│   ├── solution.py\
│   ├── Problem-001.md\
│\
├── Problem-002/\
│   ├── solution.py\
│   ├── Problem-002.md\
│\
└── README.md


- Each problem is stored in its own directory (`Problem-XXX`).
- Each directory contains a solution (`solution.py`).
- Each directory has a markdown file (`Problem-XXX.md`) that provides a description of the problem, the solution provided, its performance metrics, and explanations.
